**Objective**: Perform sensitivity analysis and FFP testing on a dataset of digital health metrics to evaluate the viability of a new health monitoring solution.

**Dataset**: Hypothetical dataset of health metrics collected from wearable devices.

**Tools**: Python, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn

Dataset Description
-------------------

The dataset consists of health metrics collected from wearable devices, including heart rate, step count, sleep duration, and sensor accuracy. Each row represents a unique observation for a particular individual.

| ID | HeartRate | StepCount | SleepDuration | SensorAccuracy | Outcome |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 72 | 10000 | 7.5 | 0.95 | Healthy |
| 2 | 85 | 8500 | 6.0 | 0.90 | Unhealthy |
| 3 | 90 | 5000 | 5.5 | 0.85 | Unhealthy |
| 4 | 60 | 12000 | 8.0 | 0.97 | Healthy |
| 5 | 78 | 11000 | 7.0 | 0.93 | Healthy |
