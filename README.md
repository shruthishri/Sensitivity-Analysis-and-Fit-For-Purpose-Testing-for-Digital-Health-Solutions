Sensitivity Analysis and Fit-For-Purpose Testing for Digital Health Solutions

Project Overview
Objective: Perform sensitivity analysis and FFP testing on a dataset of digital health metrics to evaluate the viability of a new health monitoring solution.

Dataset: Hypothetical dataset of health metrics collected from wearable devices.

Tools: Python, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn

Dataset Description
The dataset consists of health metrics collected from wearable devices, including heart rate, step count, sleep duration, and sensor accuracy. Each row represents a unique observation for a particular individual.

| ID | HeartRate | StepCount | SleepDuration | SensorAccuracy | Outcome |
|----|-----------|-----------|---------------|----------------|---------|
| 1  | 72        | 10000     | 7.5           | 0.95           | Healthy |
| 2  | 85        | 8500      | 6.0           | 0.90           | Unhealthy |
| 3  | 90        | 5000      | 5.5           | 0.85           | Unhealthy |
| 4  | 60        | 12000     | 8.0           | 0.97           | Healthy |
| 5  | 78        | 11000     | 7.0           | 0.93           | Healthy |
